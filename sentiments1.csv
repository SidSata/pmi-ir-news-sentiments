16,A drama based on a miraculous Missouri incident airs on HBO. And Lifetime airs a follow-up to its much-viewed R. Kelly documentary series.,"BREAKTHROUGH (2019) 8 p.m. on HBO. A tragedy happens on ice — and an apparent miracle happens off it — in this faith-based drama from the TV veteran Roxann Dawson. The screenplay is based on an actual 2015 incident in which John Smith, a Missouri teenager, fell through the frozen surface of a lake and remained submerged long enough for his heart to stop. It started pumping blood again after he was brought to a hospital — but reportedly only when his mother audibly prayed for him. That event and the community’s subsequent push to aid in John’s recovery are at the center of this movie, which follows John (Marcel Ruiz), his mother (Chrissy Metz) and father (Josh Lucas) and a young pastor (Topher Grace). The film “tells the story of John’s miraculous ordeal with an unassuming simplicity, focusing on the harrowing details of the case without an overreliance on proselytization,” Bilge Ebiri wrote in his review for The New York Times. Though faith is ever-present, he added, “the film also wisely dedicates plenty of screen time to the emergency workers and doctors struggling to bring the boy back to life. Here, religion is not in contention with medicine, but seems to work in tandem with it.”",What’s On Thursday,"['Television', 'Movies', 'Raise Hell: The Life & Times of Molly Ivins (Movie)', 'Breakthrough (Movie)', 'Surviving R Kelly (TV Program)']",0.04241089720516826

So at some point, you do whatever you have to do to do music.” That’s not exactly a stereotypical rock-star outlook, but Ronstadt didn’t have the typical rock star’s career: After reaching arena-level success in rock in the 1970s, she moved across genres, releasing albums of pop standards and Mariachi songs. (“People would think that I was trying to reinvent myself,” she says in the documentary, “but I never invented myself to start with.”) Her varied career is the focus here; it’s discussed by both Ronstadt and by interviewees like Emmylou Harris, Bonnie Raitt, Cameron Crowe, Jackson Browne and Dolly Parton. “The political intelligence and matter-of-fact feminism that emerge in this portrait are among its most intriguing aspects,” A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times.

I visited at the end of May, only a couple of days before the opening date of the tour, and among Dio’s team, there was a tangible air of anticipation. Dio never became a household name, but he is considered one of the great heavy-metal vocalists of all time, up there with Ozzy Osbourne (whom he replaced in Black Sabbath) and metal-adjacent rockers like Axl Rose and Robert Plant. Beginning in the 1970s, Dio took a lead role in codifying a number of his genre’s most ludicrous, yet utterly foundational, conventions. He sang of wolves and demons, toured with an animatronic dragon and supposedly introduced the splay-fingered “devil horns” headbanger’s salute, which he claimed his Italian grandmother used to flash as an old-world method of warding off the malocchio and other forms of bad luck.",Dead Runners,"['Music', 'Holography', 'Pop and Rock Music', '3-D Devices and Effects', 'Callas, Maria', 'Houston, Whitney', 'Holly, Buddy']",-0.36458792370403414
1112,"The magazine’s Ethicist columnist on whether to purchase items from a pawnbroker, intervene in another family’s conflict and more.","Money isn’t an object; I could easily go to a big-box store. However, purchasing something used seems more environmentally friendly and frugal, and there are several pawnshops in my neighborhood. On the one hand, it seems exploitative to participate in this industry. I don’t want my good price to come at the expense of someone who needs a quick infusion of cash. On the other hand, it would be presumptuous to assume that whoever sold the item in the first place isn’t acting in their own best interest. You could argue that I am indirectly providing an opportunity for someone to sell something if they could use the cash. Of course, if the owner were disreputable and the TV had been stolen, this would be unethical.

Beginning in the 1970s, Dio took a lead role in codifying a number of his genre’s most ludicrous, yet utterly foundational, conventions.

1541,A “branded narrative” from Renault pushes the boundary of just how far an ad can go to avoid selling its product.,"I recently resolved to kick one of my least-favorite habits: crying during movie trailers. I can weep without shame watching movies themselves.

Professionally expressive faces projected across field-of-vision-encompassing screens, uttering heart-rending phonemes rid of all meaningful context, accompanied by huge swells of music? I am this easily played, I tell myself, somehow rolling my eyes while simultaneously dabbing at them with the back of my hand, in case anyone nearby might think I’m that moved by the prospect of seeing, I don’t know, “Dolittle.” The problem, at bottom, is one of category confusion.

4671,Patrick Stewart returns to “Star Trek” in a new streaming show. And a “Grey’s Anatomy” spinoff begins its third season on ABC.,"STAR TREK: PICARD Stream on CBS All Access. “Tea, Earl Grey, decaf.” That’s Jean-Luc Picard’s new beverage order in “Picard,” the latest “Star Trek” TV series and a return to the franchise for Patrick Stewart, who plays the title character. (For those not hip enough for “Star Trek” references: The order used to be “tea, Earl Grey, hot.”) The new show finds Picard — the erstwhile commander of the famous fictional starship known as the Enterprise — in reflective form, grappling with the past as an aged version of himself. It has a starry showrunner in the Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Michael Chabon, who will presumably bring a new kind of energy to the franchise. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Stewart said he was drawn to the new story because it explored “the profound psychological differences in the character, who felt abandoned, distrusted and unnecessary.” Stewart asked, “Where is he now? What matters to him? What control does he have over his life? Very little, as it turned out.”",What’s On Thursday,"['Television', 'Movies']",0.06175044717240653

In a recent interview with The New York Times, Stewart said he was drawn to the new story because it explored “the profound psychological differences in the character, who felt abandoned, distrusted and unnecessary.” Stewart asked, “Where is he now?

Or, rather, she picks up a curse that comes in the form of La Llorona (Marisol Ramirez), a weeping woman who starts terrorizing the family. (The character is based on a figure from Mexican folklore.) “More efficient than ambitious, ‘La Llorona’ is basically a maternal showdown with shock cuts and billowing curtains,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. “The director Michael Chaves, making the most of his silkily mobile, at times predatory camera (he likes to shift the point of view mid-prowl) delivers the horror classics nicely.” One of the movie’s producers is James Wan, known for the “Saw” and “Conjuring” movies.

7421,Gideon Glick shines — and sings — in a moving Off Broadway revival of “Little Shop of Horrors.”,"“He’s a strange little man.” That’s how the New York actor Gideon Glick describes Seymour Krelborn, the menschy, dorky, ultimately murderous antihero of the cult classic musical “Little Shop of Horrors,” whom Glick, 31, is currently playing through March in an Off Broadway revival that runs at the Westside Theater. The production opened in October with the actor Jonathan Groff in the role, but Glick, who was at the time starring as Dill Harris in Aaron Sorkin’s Broadway adaptation of “To Kill a Mockingbird,” filled in for two weeks in November when Groff had a conflict. At the end of that temporary stint — during which Glick’s deep skills as one of New York’s best contemporary character actors (namely, his ability to channel his own inherent strangeness, his high voice often cracking, his knees seemingly quaking) were on full, glorious display — the director, Michael Mayer, asked if he wanted to take over the role after Groff finished his contract.",On Stage: Plant Life,"['Glick, Gideon', 'Little Shop of Horrors (Play)', 'Theater', 'ACTORS AND ACTRESSES']",0.6963154764933622
